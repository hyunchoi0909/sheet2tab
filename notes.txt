	figure out what to do with multiple voices for guitar pro file, use some classical guitar part
	begin processing and finish before next week; consider parallelizing
General
	ignore bass (less than 6 strings) and percussion
	keep vocals for now

features
	basically gonna do machine translation of guitar frets
	options: sparse representation/sequential representation
	features: pitches as list (lowest to highest); string fretting
	optional features: length, hammeron,pulloff,slide,
model options in terms of complexity
	rnn, bidirectional rnn
	lstm, bidirectional lstm
